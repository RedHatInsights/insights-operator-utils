# In order to generate class diagram, `plantuml.jar` needs to be installed
# and added into `CLASSPATH`. The Java archive file `plantuml.jar` is available
# at https://plantuml.com/download. It is possible just to download the Java
# archive into this directory and not to update `CLASSPATH` environment
# variable.
#
# More info about `CLASSPATH` is available at
# https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/environment/paths.html
